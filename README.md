Tutorial on MDPs and Dynamic Programming

You can either clone this repository to work on your local machine, or use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com). To work locally follow the instructions below.

First, clone the repository:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/pucrs-automated-planning/mdp-dp.git
```

If you have not configured your python environment already, we recommend using [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com). Once you have anaconda, you should configure your local environment and install the required packages as follows:

```zsh
conda create -n rl python=3.9
conda activate rl
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

You are now ready to run Jupyter notebooks locally:

```zsh
jupyter notebook
```
